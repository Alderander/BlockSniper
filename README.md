For detailed information, check out the [Website.](http://blocksniper.tk/)

## Development!
BlockSniper is currently under heavy development. Stable releases will be drafted at [Releases](https://github.com/Sandertv/BlockSniper/releases).
If you do decide to compile a phar file yourself to benefit from the latest features, here's how:
 - Download the .ZIP file with the big green button.
 - Go to pmt.mcpe.me and convert the .ZIP file to a phar file.
 - Upload your phar file to your server and restart the server.

## What is this?
BlockSniper is an advanced world editing tool, based on the idea of VoxelSniper from minecraft PC softwares.
BlockSniper allows you to edit your world on a long range, with several different types. The types are as follows:
> Cuboid    > Spawn a cube on the target location
>
> Sphere    > Spawn a sphere on the target location
>
> Overlay   > Overlay blocks with a different type
>
> Layer     > Lay a thin layer of blocks on the target location
>
> More coming soon!

## How does it work?
BlockSniper has several commands to edit your world. The commands work as follows:
>> /snipe <type> <radius> <block(s)> : Snipe an edit type at the location you're looking at.
>
> Additional blocks can be added by sepparating them with a comma.
>
>
>> /brushwand <type> <radius> <block(s)> : Set a wand with an edit type to shoot everytime you hold your finger on the screen or interact.
>
> Additional blocks can here too be added by sepparating them with a comma.

## Are there permissions? Where can I find them?
A full list of permissions can be found in the [plugin.yml](https://github.com/Sandertv/BlockSniper/blob/master/plugin.yml) file. 
It contains the most up to date permissions, so every permission available can be found there.
